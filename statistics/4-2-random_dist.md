[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Yes the ranom.random() distributin is uniform. The Cdf plot is linear and the Pmf plot shows each value having equal probability. The latter could be shown to illustrate the former. The fact that for every increase in value there will only be a proportional increase cummulative probability would require the Cdf to be a straight line as shown.
